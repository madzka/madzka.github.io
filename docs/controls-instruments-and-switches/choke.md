# Choke

The choke enriches the petrol mixture and is used to start the car in cold weather, or when the engine is cold.

The choke is the knob on the right of the control panel marked 'C'.

When you pull out the choke knob, it gives a progressively richer mixture of air and petrol to the engine.

The choke will hold in any position.

Depending on the weather, push the choke knob fully in or in to the 'weak' position as soon as the engine has warmed up.
- In cold weather, wait for the engine to run for several minutes with the choke pushed in to the 'weak' position.
- In warm weather push the choke control knob fully in almost immediately.

**❗️ Warning:** Do not run the engine for a long period of time with the choke knob pulled fully out because neat
fuel will be pulled into the cylinders and cause damage.
