# Temperature gauge

The temperature gauge monitors the temperature of the engine coolant.

The temperature gauge is located to the left of the speedometer. Not all models have this gauge fitted.

When the engine is off, the needle is in the cold position.

The needle will rise during the initial warm-up period of the engine. After the engine is warm, any sudden upward change in the temperature gauge requires immediate attention. Stop the engine and contact your licensed dealer.
