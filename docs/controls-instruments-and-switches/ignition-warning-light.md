# Ignition warning light

The ignition warning light serves to remind the driver to switch off the ignition. It also acts as a no-charge indicator.

The ignition warning light is located on the instrument panel.

When the ignition is switched on, the warning light is illuminated when the engine is not running, or is running at a very low speed. As the engine speed increases, the light will dim and then go out. This will happen at a fairly low speed.

If the ignition warning light fails to dim and go out at higher engine speeds, or remains alight at all times, inspect the dynamo driving belt for correct tension or breakage. If the belt is in order, the charging system must be serviced by a licensed dealer.
