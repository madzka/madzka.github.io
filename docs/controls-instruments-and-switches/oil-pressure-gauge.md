# Oil pressure gauge

The oil pressure gauge indicates the oil pressure in the engine.

The oil pressure gauge is located to the right of the speedometer.

This reads approximately 60 lbs/sq in. (4.22kg/cm2) under normal running conditions.

There is an [oil pressure warning light]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/controls-instruments-and-switches/oil-pressure-light.md %}).
