# Starter switch

The starter switch works when the ignition is on to fire up the engine ready for driving.

The starter switch is the circular black knob on the floor in front of the driver's seat.
- Push the knob down quickly and firmly with your thumb or forefinger to operate the starter.
- Release it as soon as the engine fires.

**📝 Note:** If the engine fails to start, wait until the crankshaft comes to rest before pushing the starter switch
again.
