# Fuel gauge

The fuel gauge indicates the approximate level of fuel in the fuel tank.

The fuel gauge is located in the central instrument panel underneath the speedometer.

It only indicates the fuel level when the ignition switch is in the 'On' position.

The gauge may move slightly during braking, turning, accelerating or going up and down hills.

**❗️ CAUTION:** Refuel before the gauge reaches empty.
