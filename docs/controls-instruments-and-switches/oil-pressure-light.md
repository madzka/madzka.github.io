# Oil pressure light

The oil pressure warning light illuminates to alert the driver when oil pressure is too low.

The oil pressure warning light is located on the central instrument panel to the left of the fuel gauge.

It glows green when the ignition is switched on prior to starting the engine. The warning light stops glowing once the engine is running.

If the light continues to glow while the engine is running, stop the engine. Check the oil level in the engine sump and replenish the oil if necessary.

If the light still continues to glow while the engine is running, have the lubrication system checked by a authorized dealer.
