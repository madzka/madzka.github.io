4. Jack the car.
5. Remove the wheel and replace with the new wheel.
6. Replace the wheel nuts, ensuring that the tapered ends facd toward the wheel.
7. Lower the jack.
8. Fully tighten the wheel nuts in sequence 1, 3, 4, 2 (imagining them to be numbered 1 to 4 in rotation clockwise).
9. Refit the hub cover.
