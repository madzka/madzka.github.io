# Removing hub covers

You need to remove the hub cover when you want to undo the wheel nuts to change a wheel. Use the wheelbrace tool
and a special technique to remove the wheel hub cover.

1. Insert the flattened end of the wheelbrace into one of the recesses between the edge of the cover and the road wheel.
2. Use a sideways motion with the wheelbrace to prise off the cover.  
  **❗️ Warning:** Do not use an upward levering motion.
3. Insert the flattened end of the wheelbrace between the lip of the cover and wheel rim.
4. Using the tyre as a fulcrum at a point diametrically opposite the tyre valve, ever the cover away from the wheel.
