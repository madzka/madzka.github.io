# Starting

Starting the car involves a sequence of actions, and can require using the choke in cold weather.

## Starting the car

The ignition switch lets you engage the engine as a precursor to starting the car. When the ignition is 'on' you can run the radio and heater. Turn the ignition to 'start' when you want to start the engine.

The ignition switch is located in the centre of the control panel and is operated by a key. The switch has two position:
'on' and 'start'.

1. Insert the key into the ignition switch.
2. Turn the key clockwise to the 'on' position. The ignition warning light displays.  
  **❗️ Important:** Never leave the ignition switch in the 'on' position when the engine is not running because this will draw power from the battery.  
  **📝 Note:** Ensure the gear lever is in the neutral position.
3. Turn the key clockwise to the 'start' position.
4. Press the starter switch quickly and firmly. The engine starts.  
  **📝 Note:** If the engine fails to start, wait until the crankshaft comes to rest before pushing the starter switch again.  
  **❗️ Important:** Don't continue to hold the starter switch down if the engine fails to start because this draws a heavy current and may completely discharge the battery.

## Starting the car when cold

In cold weather, or when the engine is cold, use the choke to help you turn the engine over and start the car. Let the
engine warm up before you start driving.
1. Put the gear lever in neutral position.
2. Pull out the choke.
3. Switch on the ignition.
4. Press the starter switch.  
  The crankshaft will rotate and after a couple of seconds the engine will start.
5. Immediately release the starter switch.
6. Run the engine at approximately 1,000 rpm, corresponding to a speed of 14 mph (23 kph) in top gear for several minutes.  
  The engine will quickly attain correct working temperature.  
  **❗️ Warning:** Don't attempt to warm up the engine by allowing it to idle slowly because this leads to excessive cylinder wear.
7. Push the choke fully in.
